# NanoLinks-KG SPARQL Query examples

This repository is part of the research output of the paper "Interoperable nanosafety data using semantic modeling and linked data knowledge graphs".

The repository contains example SPARQL queries to retrieve data from the NanoLinks-KG. Some of these queries were used for the interoperability layer built to integrate with NanoCommons knowledge base.
